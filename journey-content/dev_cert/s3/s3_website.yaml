        Comments: >
          By default and following best practices, S3 buckets are blocked from
          public access. That means you can't create public objects. Unchecking
          [-Block all public access-] will allow you to create public objects,
          it will not make your bucket or your objects public.

          This bucket policy will make your bucket objects public. So anyone with
          the right link will be able to access it, this is good for public websites.
